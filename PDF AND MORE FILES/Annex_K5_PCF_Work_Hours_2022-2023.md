**Case Number:** LS25P20195

## 1. Purpose of this annex

1. This annex provides objective evidence of my previous employment with **PCF** during 2022–2023. It is relied on to demonstrate:
   - a stable work history before I moved to Kober Limited in July 2023;  
   - continuous lawful income;  
   - long-term financial responsibility and ability to meet Natasha's needs.

2. For clarity, the PCF role was **not a night-shift position**. Night-shift employment is evidenced separately in **Exhibit WH – Kober Night-Shift Employment and Childcare Evidence**.

## 2. Contents of WH_PCf_WORK_HOURS_2022-2023.pdf

3. The combined PDF **WH_PCf_WORK_HOURS_2022-2023.pdf** contains scanned paper time-cards from my employment with PCF, together with an automatically generated metadata index.

4. The document includes:

   1. **Metadata index (first pages):**
      - For each image file (e.g. `20220320_120822.jpg`) the index lists:
        - file name;  
        - parsed date (e.g. `2022-03-20`);  
      - The dates run from **20 March 2022 to 13 May 2023**, confirming the chronology of the underlying time-cards.

   2. **Time-cards (remaining pages):**
      - Scans of original PCF time-cards with clock-in and clock-out times;  
      - Each card shows:
        - my name;  
        - the date;  
        - hours worked and totals;  
      - The scans correspond to the dates listed in the metadata index.

5. The PDF has been optimised for court use and saved under the final bundle name **WH_PCf_WORK_HOURS_2022-2023.pdf**.

## 3. Employment history and financial stability

6. The PCF time-cards show that throughout 2022 and early 2023 I:

   - worked **regular, structured shifts**;  
   - received continuous earnings;  
   - had no gaps suggesting unemployment or chaotic work patterns.

7. This is consistent with the bank statements and Halifax summaries filed within **Exhibit K – Financial Evidence Bundle**, and demonstrates:

   - stable income over an extended period;  
   - consistent payment of tax and National Insurance;  
   - long-term financial responsibility prior to the move to Kober in July 2023.

8. My subsequent employment at Kober (see Exhibit WH) therefore did not arise from instability or crisis, but from an already established pattern of lawful work and supporting my family financially.

## 4. Relevance to the welfare checklist

9. Under section 1(3)(f) of the Children Act 1989, the Court must consider "the capability of each of the child's parents … in meeting his needs".

10. The PCF work-hours evidence is relevant because it shows that:

   - I have been **consistently employed** for several years;  
   - I have maintained an income sufficient to contribute to Natasha's housing, food and everyday needs;  
   - my move to night-shift work at Kober was a continuation of a pattern of regular employment, not a departure from it.

11. Taken with the Halifax summaries and support logs, this annex supports the conclusion that I am financially stable and capable of meeting Natasha's needs, both historically and going forward.

## 5. Separation from night-shift childcare evidence

12. For the avoidance of doubt:

   - **Annex K5 (this document)** relates only to my **previous PCF employment** and is filed within **Exhibit K – Financial Evidence Bundle** as an income/employment record.  
   - **Exhibit WH – Kober Night-Shift Employment and Childcare Evidence** deals with my **night-shift work from July 2023 onwards** and the associated daytime childcare arrangements for Natasha.

13. I respectfully invite the Court to read Annex K5 together with:
   - **Exhibit K – Financial Evidence Bundle** (housing costs, budgeting, Halifax summaries, support logs); and  
   - **Exhibit WH – Kober night-shift evidence**, when assessing both my financial stability and my capability to meet Natasha's needs.
