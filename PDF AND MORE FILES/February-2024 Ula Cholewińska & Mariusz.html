I\'ve always helped you and I will help you. You don\'t even see how you\'re behaving. I\'m not blind, I see it\'s hard for you, but with an attitude like today, nothing will improve. If you want to talk or need help, I\'m always up for it. I don\'t care how you talk to me, blaming me for everything. For all I care, we don\'t have to talk if this is how it\'s going to be. I\'m coming to see my daughter, you have no idea how much I miss her. And this "weekend dad" thing... you have no other plan than to blame me. What do you expect? I want to see the girls, and you start on about some junkie and the same old story. You\'re taking away our moments together. We are not a couple, so why are you talking about the past? You want support, but look how you behave. I\'m supposed to be a shoulder to cry on, just to get an earful from you. You won\'t even sit down and talk, you just fly off the handle. If that\'s how you want to live, it\'s your choice. Don\'t expect things to get better. I know you\'ve had worse days lately, I can feel it. I know you, Ula. I see you\'re struggling. You\'re managing, yes, but you\'re going to exhaust yourself. I feel for you. Open up, or start talking to me normally. I\'m not forcing you, you have to want it yourself. I don\'t need this drama, our whole family loses. But I\'m not here to tell you what to do. I\'m not turning my back on you, and yet you act like this. For me, every moment with you all is precious, but everything has its limits. I hope you understand. This isn\'t the first time I\'m saying this, and it doesn\'t make me happy at all.' },

I won\'t force it if you don\'t want to talk. It\'s a shame I can\'t count on you like you can on me. I don\'t cause you any problems, but look how you behave. Zero understanding.
