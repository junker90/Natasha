## 3. Claims, evidence and analysis

### 3.1 Claim: father presents risk / avoids scrutiny

**CLAIM**  
There is an implied concern that the father presents a risk and/or that there is a negative police history which should weigh heavily in the risk assessment.

**EVIDENCE**  
- 101 Live Chat (D1.2) – the father himself proactively asks police if there is any report made about him.  
- Police email return (D1.3) – written confirmation regarding the absence or limited nature of any records relating to the father.  
- ACRO Subject Access (Exhibit E1) – no PNC record.

**ANALYSIS**  
The pattern of evidence shows a father actively seeking clarity and transparency from police, rather than avoiding scrutiny. Official databases (PNC via ACRO, police email return) do not show a pattern of offending or risk from the father.

**CONCLUSION**  
There is no evidential basis for treating the father as someone with a concerning police history or as an unmitigated risk on the basis of police records.

### 3.2 Claim: "Concern for safety" indicates paternal violence

**CLAIM**  
The existence of a "concern for safety" entry is sometimes loosely presented as if it evidences violent or abusive conduct by the father.

**EVIDENCE**  
- Concern for Safety report (D1.1) – initiated by the father, not against him.  
- Content of D1.1 – describes systematic obstruction of contact and welfare worries, rather than admitting violent conduct.

**ANALYSIS**  
The concern was raised by the father as a protective step, asking police to note his worries about Natasha’s welfare and the obstruction of contact. It does not constitute a finding of wrongdoing by him.

**CONCLUSION**  
D1.1 should properly be treated as evidence of proactive safeguarding and documentation by the father, not as proof of violent behaviour.

## 4. Legal relevance and respectful submission

I respectfully submit that Exhibit D shows:

- that I have engaged with West Yorkshire Police in a transparent and proactive way;  
- that there is no adverse police history evidencing a pattern of offending or domestic abuse on my part; and  
- that the "concern for safety" record originates from my own report about contact obstruction and welfare issues, rather than from any finding of violence by me.

It is my respectful submission that the court should treat Exhibit D as corroborating my position that I have sought to document concerns properly and that there is no police record consistent with the more serious allegations advanced against me.
