## Exhibit L1 – Email to Solicitor re Lack of Contact (11.10.2024)

Document: Email from the father to trainee solicitor (11 October 2024).  
Content: Father reports having no contact or information regarding his daughter since mid-July, notes that the mother is not responding to messages nor to the solicitor’s previous email, and asks whether to contact children’s services or await further legal action.  
Evidential value: Demonstrates early and appropriate escalation via legal representative; supports the pattern of contact obstruction by the mother and shows the father’s focus on lawful, child-focused solutions.
